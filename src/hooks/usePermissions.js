/**
 * Encapsulated permission API for components.
 *
 * Components should NEVER read the raw `acl` object or call `hasPermission`
 * directly — they ask this hook instead. All ACL-structure knowledge lives in
 * `utils/jwt.js`; this hook is a thin, logic-free binding of `acl` from auth
 * state to those pure functions.
 *
 * Binds whichever session is actually active. The two surfaces carry unrelated
 * JWTs (see UserAuthContext.jsx) but land on the SAME acl shape — the admin's
 * from its token's claims, the portal's from `user.acl.data` in the login
 * response body — so both feed the same pure functions below. Without this
 * fallback every screen shared with the portal (DIDs, PBXRouting) reads an
 * admin `acl` of null under a portal session and silently renders read-only.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const { can } = usePermissions();
 *   {can('accounts', 'write') && <EditButton/>}
 *   if (!canAccess('routes')) return <Redirect/>;
 *
 * @returns {{ can: (screen: string, action?: string) => boolean,
 *            canAccess: (screen: string) => boolean }}
